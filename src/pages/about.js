      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>I am a full stack software developer specializing in JavaScript (React and Node) currently seeking a new opportunity. I previously worked in marketing roles in the music and education industries connecting consumers with unique experiences. However, I have always been fascinated by the endless potential for technology and realized that I wanted to build the experiences themselves. Learning to code at Fullstack Academy has launched my journey and I now aim to utilize these skills to contribute to an innovative company improving the world. I look forward to connecting with you soon!</p>
